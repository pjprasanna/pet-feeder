# pet-feeder
This project is a pet feeder that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Google Assistant to help pet owners feed their furry friends remotely. The pet feeder can be controlled through a  mobile application(Google Home) using Google Assistant.

The project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller and a servo motor to dispense a predetermined amount of pet food on a set schedule. The user can set the feeding schedule and portion size through the mobile application or voice commands.

The pet feeder also includes a camera to allow the user to remotely monitor their pet during feeding time. The camera feed can be accessed through the mobile application or web interface.

This project is open source and available on GitHub. It includes all the necessary code and instructions to build your own pet feeder with Google Assistant integration. Whether you're a pet owner looking for a convenient feeding solution or an IoT enthusiast looking for a new project, this pet feeder with Google Assistant integration is a great way to explore the possibilities of IoT technology.
